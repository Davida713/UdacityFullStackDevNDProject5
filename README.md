# UdacityFullStackDevNDProject5


Project is hosted at: 52.32.75.168 SSH Port: 2200

http://ec2-52-32-75-168.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/

To run this program I installed PostgrSQL, Apache, Flask, SQLalchemy, and OAuth2

I heavely used the following guide to get flask up on the server:

I also used Udacity's provided cources as well as the forums.
